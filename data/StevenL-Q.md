First QA issue - Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A cheap way to store constants in a single location is to create an internal constant in a library. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

15: uint256 private constant GRACE_PERIOD_TIME = 3600;
16: uint256 public constant VAULTS_LENGTH = 2;
