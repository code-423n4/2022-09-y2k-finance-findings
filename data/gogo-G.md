## Gas Optimizations Report

### The usage of `++i` will cost less gas than `i++`. The same change can be applied to `i--` as well.

This change would save up to 6 gas per instance/loop.

_There are **1** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol

443:  for (uint256 i = 0; i < epochsLength(); i++) {
```

### State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them.

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replace each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

```

### Using `!= 0` on `uints` costs less gas than `> 0`.

This change saves 3 gas per instance/loop

_There are **2** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

119:  require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0");

134:  if (reward > 0) {
```

### It costs more gas to initialize non-`constant`/non-`immutable` variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied

Not overwriting the default for stack variables saves 8 gas. Storage and memory variables have larger savings

_There are **2** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

36:   uint256 public periodFinish = 0;
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/tree/main/src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

```solidity
File: src/Vault.sol

443:  for (uint256 i = 0; i < epochsLength(); i++) {
```

### Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

_There are **1** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: src/Controller.sol

16:   uint256 public constant VAULTS_LENGTH = 2;
```

### Functions that are access-restricted from most users may be marked as `payable`

Marking a function as `payable` reduces gas cost since the compiler does not have to check whether a payment was provided or not. This change will save around 21 gas per function call.

_There are **3** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

225:  function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/tree/main/src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

```solidity
File: src/VaultFactory.sol

295:  function setController(address _controller) public onlyAdmin {

366:  function changeOracle(address _token, address _oracle) public onlyAdmin {
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/tree/main/src/VaultFactory.sol

### `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++I}`/`unchecked{I++}` in `for`-loops

When an increment or any arithmetic operation is not possible to overflow it should be placed in `unchecked{}` block. \This is because of the default compiler overflow and underflow safety checks since Solidity version 0.8.0. \In for-loops it saves around 30-40 gas **per loop**

```

### `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables

_There are **1** instances of this issue:_

```solidity

195:  marketIndex += 1;
```

### Usage of `uint`s/`int`s smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

'When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.' \ https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/internals/layout_in_storage.html \ Use a larger size then downcast where needed

### Don't compare boolean expressions to boolean literals

Use `if(x)`/`if(!x)` instead of `if(x == true)`/`if(x == false)`.

### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for function parameters

If a reference type function parameter is read-only, it is cheaper in gas to use calldata instead of memory. Calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory. Try to use calldata as a data location because it will avoid copies and also makes sure that the data cannot be modified.

### Replace `x <= y` with `x < y + 1`, and `x >= y` with `x > y - 1`

In the EVM, there is no opcode for `>=` or `<=`. When using greater than or equal, two operations are performed: `>` and `=`. Using strict comparison operators hence saves gas

### `require()/revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas

Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 incurs an MSTORE which costs 3 gas

### Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save ~50 gas each time they're hitby avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string. Not defining the strings also save deployment gas
