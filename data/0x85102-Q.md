A/ require() should be used instead of assert()

Prior to solidity version 0.8.0, hitting an assert consumes the remainder of the transaction's available gas rather than returning it, as require()/revert() do. assert() should be avoided even past solidity version 0.8.0 as its documentation states that "The assert function creates an error of type Panic(uint256). ... Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix".
