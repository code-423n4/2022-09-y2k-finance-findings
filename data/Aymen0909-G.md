## Findings

### 1- Multiple address mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address to a struct :

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

There are 3 instances of this issue :

```
File: src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

43      mapping(address => uint256) public userRewardPerTokenPaid;
44      mapping(address => uint256) public rewards;
47      mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
```

These mappings could be refactored into the following struct and mapping for example :

```
struct User {
    uint256 userRewardPerTokenPaid;
    uint256 rewards;
    uint256 _balances;
}
    
mapping(address => User) public users;
```

### 2- `indexVaults` mapping should use a fixed-length array to save gas :

The `indexVaults` mapping stores the hedge & risk vault addresses for a given market index, because there will be always only two addresses to be stored `[address(hedge), address(risk)]` the mapping should use a fixed-length (static) array of 2 elements `address[2]` instead of a dynamic array, this will save ~20000 Gas when creating a new market.

There is 1 instance of this issue :

```
File: src/Vault.sol

119     mapping(uint256 => address[]) public indexVaults;
```

This should be replaced by :

```
mapping(uint256 => address[2]) public indexVaults;
```

### 3- State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable` :

Avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (100 gas) with a PUSH32 (3 gas).

There are 5 instances of this issue:

```
File: src/SemiFungibleVault.sol

20      string public name;
21      string public symbol;

File: src/rewards/RewardsFactory.sol

17      address public admin;
18      address public govToken;
19      address public factory;
```

### 4- `epochsLength()` should not be looked up in every iteration in the for loop :

`epochsLength()` reads directely from storage thus costing more gas, it shouldn't be called at each iteration, its value should be cached into a memory variable

There is 1 instance of this issue:

```
File: src/Vault.sol

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < epochsLength(); i++) {
        if (epochs[i] == _epoch) {
            if (i == epochsLength() - 1) {
                return 0;
            }
            return epochs[i + 1];
        }
    }
```

This should be refactored as follow :

``` 
    uint256 len = epochsLength();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (epochs[i] == _epoch) {
            if (i == len - 1) {
                return 0;
            }
            return epochs[i + 1];
        }
    }
```

### 5- Use custom errors rather than `require()`/`revert()` strings to save deployments gas :

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met) while providing the same amount of information.

File: src/Vault.sol

165     require((shares = previewDeposit(id, assets)) != 0, "ZeroValue");
187     require(msg.value > 0, "ZeroValue");

File: src/SemiFungibleVault.sol

91      require((shares = previewDeposit(id, assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");
116     require(
            msg.sender == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, receiver),
            "Only owner can withdraw, or owner has approved receiver for all"
        );

File: src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

96      require(amount != 0, "Cannot stake 0");
119     require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0");
202     require(
            rewardRate <= balance.div(rewardsDuration),
            "Provided reward too high"
        );
217     require(
            tokenAddress != address(stakingToken),
            "Cannot withdraw the staking token"
        );
226     require(
            block.timestamp > periodFinish,
            "Previous rewards period must be complete before changing the duration for the new period"
        );

File: src/oracles/PegOracle.sol

23      require(_oracle1 != address(0), "oracle1 cannot be the zero address");
24      require(_oracle2 != address(0), "oracle2 cannot be the zero address");
25      require(_oracle1 != _oracle2, "Cannot be same Oracle");
28      require(
            (priceFeed1.decimals() == priceFeed2.decimals()),
            "Decimals must be the same"
        );
98      require(price1 > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
99      require(
            answeredInRound1 >= roundID1,
            "RoundID from Oracle is outdated!"
        );
103     require(timeStamp1 != 0, "Timestamp == 0 !");
121     require(price2 > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
122     require(
            answeredInRound2 >= roundID2,
            "RoundID from Oracle is outdated!"
        );
126     require(timeStamp2 != 0, "Timestamp == 0 !");
```

### 6- It costs more gas to initialize variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied :

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (0 for uint or int, false for bool, address(0) for addressâ€¦). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

There are 3 instances of this issue:

```
File: src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol

36      uint256 public periodFinish = 0;

File: src/Vault.sol

443     for (uint256 i = 0; i < epochsLength(); i++)

File: src/VaultFactory.sol

159     marketIndex = 0;
```

### 7- Use of ++i cost less gas than i++/i=i+1 in for loops :

There is 1 instance of this issue:

```
File: src/Vault.sol

443     for (uint256 i = 0; i < epochsLength(); i++)
```

### 8- ++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as in the case when used in for & while loops :

There is 1 instance of this issue:

```
File: src/Vault.sol

443     for (uint256 i = 0; i < epochsLength(); i++)
```

### 9- Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked **payable** :

If a function modifier such as **onlyAdmin** is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for the owner because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are : 

CALLVALUE(gas=2), DUP1(gas=3), ISZERO(gas=3), PUSH2(gas=3), JUMPI(gas=10), PUSH1(gas=3), DUP1(gas=3), REVERT(gas=0), JUMPDEST(gas=1), POP(gas=2). 
Which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost
